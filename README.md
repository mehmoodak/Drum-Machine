# Drum Machine

This project is made to complete a challange on FreeCodeCamp as a part of getting React Certification. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

In this project I made a drum machine with React which plays different sounds present on buttons by clicking the buttons or pressing the keys with the keyboard.
